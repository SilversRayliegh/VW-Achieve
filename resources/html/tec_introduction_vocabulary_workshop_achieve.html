            <p>At each level of <strong><span class="text-primary">VOCABULARY WORKSHOP ACHIEVE</span></strong>, students are introduced to 300 carefully
                selected, high-utility words, many of them drawn from academic vocabulary word lists relevant
                to students’ reading. Mastery of these words promotes word consciousness and, together with
                practice in vocabulary strategies, leads to improved reading and writing skills and improved
                performance on high-stakes standardized tests.</p>

                        attention on 10 words at a time and facilitating classroom implementation. First in Set A and
                        then in Set B,
                        students are provided with instruction concentrated on 10 words each and practice with those
                        words in a variety of contexts. Units conclude with
                        synonym and antonym practice with
                        all 20 words.</p>
