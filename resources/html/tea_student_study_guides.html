                            When students employ a review system for their vocabularies, they tend to learn the words
                            and their meanings more thoroughly. Students may create flash cards or vocabulary charts
                            as two simple review methods. What students write down on their flash cards or charts may
                            vary among learning styles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b class="text-primary">For Basic Vocabulary Learners:</b> Students should write the
                            vocabulary word on one side of
                            a flash card (or in the first chart box), a mnemonic device that helps them recall the
                            word’s
                            meaning, and a synonym or brief definition of the word. On the back of the flash card
                            (or in chart boxes two, three, and four), have students write a short student-created phrase
                            incorporating the word. Students should then review by looking only at the word side of the
                            flash card (or at the first column of the chart, folding the paper so the other information
                            is
                            behind the first column) and by seeing if they can remember the mnemonic device or
                            phrase that enables them to recall the word’s meaning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b class="text-primary">For Kinesthetic Learners:</b> Students may create a motion that goes
                            with a vocabulary word
                            definition when possible. Students should then write the word on one side of a flash card
                            (or in the first chart box), then the motion and a synonym or brief definition on the back
                            of
                            the flash card (or in the second and third chart boxes). Students may review by looking
                            only at the word side of the flashcard (or at the first column of the chart, folding the
                            paper
                            so the other information is behind the first column) and seeing if they can recall first the
                            motion and then the word’s meaning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b class="text-primary">For Visual/Artistic Learners:</b> Students should draw a picture that goes with each
                            vocabulary word definition. They may write the word on one side of a flash card (or in the
                            first chart box) and then draw the associated picture and write the synonym or brief
                            definition on the back of the flash card (or in the second and third chart boxes). Students
                            should then review by looking only at the word side of the flash card (or at the first
                            column
                            of the chart, folding the paper so the other information is behind the first column) and
                            seeing if they can recall first the drawing and then the word’s meaning.

                            <b class="text-primary">For Auditory Learners:</b> In addition to the Basic Vocabulary Learner review sheet,
                            teachers may strongly encourage these learners to review <img style="height: 22px;margin-bottom:-4px" src="../images/iw-p6.jpg"> on a daily basis to
                            recall definitions.
