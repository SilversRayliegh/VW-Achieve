                    <p>For more than five decades <strong><span class="text-primary">VOCABULARY WORKSHOP</span></strong>
                        has helped millions of students
                        increase their vocabularies, improve their reading, writing, and speaking skills, and prepare
                        for standardized tests.</p>

                    <p><strong><span class="text-primary">VOCABULARY WORKSHOP ACHIEVE</span></strong> continues the
                        tradition in a redesigned format and with important new features. Standards-aligned and
                        research-based, the program supports
                        explicit instruction of high-utility words—ten words at a time—to expand and enrich students’
                        vocabulary knowledge, provide skills that contribute to success on standardized tests, and
                        complement a literature-based approach to vocabulary instruction.</p>

                    <p><strong><span class="text-primary">VOCABULARY WORKSHOP ACHIEVE</span></strong> supplies
                        instruction and practice with 300 words organized in 15 Units of 20 words each. Each of these
                        Units is divided into two sets, focusing student attention on 10 words at a time and making
                        classroom implementation more manageable.</p>

                    <p>All vocabulary words appear in one of the two related reading passages that begin and
                        conclude the Units, providing students with multiple exposures to the words in the context of
                        rich and engaging informational text, with examples of proper usage. These
                        passages also serve as starting points for discussions of word meanings and semantic
                        relationships.</p>

                    <p>The <strong><span class="text-primary">VOCABULARY WORKSHOP ACHIEVE</span></strong>  word lists consist of high-utility, academic vocabulary
                        relevant to students’ classroom and independent reading. These are words that students
                        will also encounter on standards-aligned exams.</p>

                    <p>Recognizing the importance of vocabulary to success on these tests, <strong><span
                            class="text-primary">VOCABULARY WORKSHOP ACHIEVE</span></strong> includes practice with vocabulary and reading skills in standardizedtest formats modeled on current standards-based exams.</p>
