                        <p>Word Study helps build word knowledge with strategies to help you look closely at words for meanings. Word Study instruction and practice include <strong>Idioms</strong>, <strong>Denotation and Connotation</strong>, and <strong>Classical Roots</strong>. </p>
                        <div class="h2-p8" style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Idioms</strong></div>
                        <p> Three Word Study sections feature instruction on and practice with idioms. An idiom is an informal expression whose literal meaning does not help the reader or listener understand what the expression means, such as “raining cats and dogs,” “the apple of my eye,” or “a dark horse.” While every language has its own idioms, English is particularly rich in idioms and idiomatic expressions. Developing a clear understanding of idioms will help you better understand the figurative language that authors use in their writing. </p>
                        <div class="h2-p8" style="margin-top: 20px;">
                            <strong>Denotation and Connotation</strong>
                        </div>
                        <p> Instruction in <strong>Denotation and Connotation</strong> and practice with connotations is included in two of the Word Study sections. Understanding a word’s connotation will develop your skills as a reader, writer, and speaker. </p>
                        <p> Understanding the difference between denotation and connotation is important to understanding definitions and how concepts are used, as well as in choosing the right word. In these exercises, practice choosing the correct word by determining the emotional association of the word. </p>
                        <div class="h2-p8" style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Classical Roots</strong></div>
                        <div class="box-content-image-right clearfix">
                            <div class="box-left col-50" style="margin-top: 0;">
                                <p>Each Word Study includes a <strong>Classical Roots</strong> exercise that provides instruction in and practice with Greek and Latin roots. Developing a useful, transferable technique to make sense out of unfamiliar words through Greek and Latin roots will help you unlock the meanings of thousands  of words. An example word drawn from the vocabulary words in the previous Units is referenced at the top of the page and serves as a guide to help you complete the exercise.</p>
