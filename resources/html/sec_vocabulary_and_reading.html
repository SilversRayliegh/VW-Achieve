                        <p>There is a strong connection between vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension. Although comprehension is much more than recognizing words and knowing their meanings, comprehension is nearly impossible if you do not know an adequate number of words in the text you are reading or have the vocabulary skills to figure out their meaning.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top:10px;">The <strong>Reading Passages</strong> in this level provide extra practice with vocabulary words. Vocabulary words are in boldface to draw your attention to their uses and contexts. Context clues embedded in the passages encourage you to figure out the meanings of words before you read the definitions provided on the pages directly following the passages.</p>

                        <div class="h2-p8" style="margin-top: 20px;"> Test Prep</div>
                        <p>Your knowledge of word meanings and your ability to think carefully about what you read will help you succeed in school and on standards-aligned and state exams.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>Vocabulary for Comprehension</strong> exercises in each Review consist of a reading passage followed by comprehension questions. The passages and questions are similar to those that you are likely to find on standards-aligned and state exams.</p>

                        <div class="h2-p8" style="margin-top: 20px;"> Types of Questions</div>
                        <p> You are likely to encounter the following types of questions in <span class="text-primary">VOCABULARY WORKSHOP ACHIEVE</span> and on standards-aligned and state exams.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top:20px;"><b>Main Idea Questions</b> generally ask what the passage as a whole is about. Often, but not always, the main idea is stated in the first paragraph of the passage. You may also be asked the main idea of a specific paragraph. Questions about the main idea may begin like this:</p>

                        <ul class="list-p8">
                            <li>The primary or main purpose of the passage is . . .</li>
                            <li>The author’s primary or main purpose in the passage is to . . .</li>
                            <li>Which of the following statements most nearly paraphrases the author’s
                                main idea in the ninth paragraph (lines 77–88)?</li>
                            <li>The main purpose of the fourth paragraph
                                (lines 16–25) is to . . .</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                            <strong>Detail Questions</strong> focus on important information that is explicitly stated in the passage. Often, however, the correct answer choices do not use the exact language of the passage. They are instead restatements, or paraphrases, of the text. </p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                            <strong>Vocabulary in Context Questions</strong> check your ability to use context to identify a word’s
                            meaning. For example:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list-p8">
                            <li>As it is used in paragraph 2, “adherents” most nearly means . . .</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="sed-85097 page-9">
                <div class="text-center">
                    <div class="content-center">
                        <p>Use the word’s context in a passage to select the best answer, particularly when the vocabulary word has more than one meaning. The answer choices may contain two (or more) correct meanings of the word in question. Choose the meaning that best fits the context.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Inference Questions</strong> ask you to make inferences or draw conclusions from the passage. These questions often begin like this: </p>
                        <ul class="list-p8">
                            <li>It can be most reasonably inferred from the information in the fifth paragraph (lines 53–69) that . . . </li>
                            <li>The passage clearly implies that . . .</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> The inferences you make and the conclusions you draw must be based on the information in the passage. Using the facts you learn from the passage in addition to the knowledge and reasoning you already have helps you understand what is implied and reach conclusions that are logical. </p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Evidence-Based Questions</strong> ask you to provide evidence from the passage that will support the answer you provided to a previous question. These questions often begin like this: </p>
                        <ul class="list-p8">
                            <li>Which choice provides the best evidence for the answer to the previous question?</li>
                            <li>Which statement is the best evidence for the answer to the previous question?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Questions About Tone</strong> show your understanding of the author’s attitude toward the topic of the passage. To determine the tone, pay attention to the author’s word choice. The author’s attitude may be positive (respectful), negative (scornful), or neutral (distant). These are typical questions: </p>
                        <ul class="list-p8">
                            <li>The author’s primary purpose in the passage is to . . .</li>
                            <li>Which word best describes the author’s tone?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Questions About Author’s Technique</strong> focus on the way a text is organized and the language the author uses. These questions ask you to think about structure and function. For example: </p>
                        <ul class="list-p8">
                            <li>In the context of the passage, the primary function of the fourth paragraph (lines
                                30–37) is to . . .</li>
                            <li>The organizational structure of the passage is best described as . . .</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To answer the questions, you must demonstrate an understanding of the way the author presents information and develops ideas.</p>
