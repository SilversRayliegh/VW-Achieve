                    The Student Edition is organized in 15 Units of 20 words each. A Review and a Word Study feature
                    follow Units 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. A Final Mastery Test follows the last Review.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each Unit begins by introducing at least 15 of the Unit’s 20 words in the context of a nonfiction
                    reading passage. Those words not included in the opening passage always appear in the concluding
                    passage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the opening reading passage, instruction and practice with the 20 words is divided into
                    two groups of 10, <b>Set A</b> and <b>Set B</b>, concentrating student attention on 10
                    words at a time and facilitating efficient classroom implementation. Each set includes <b>Definitions</b>
                    and practice exercises that focus on 10 words, providing multiple exposures to the words in a
                    variety of contexts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Units conclude with practice with the 20 words in aggregate, including synonyms and
                    antonyms, a writing prompt, and a second reading passage, related in theme or topic to
                    the first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Reviews</b> provide further exposures in different formats to the words taught in the three

                    Exposure to new or unfamiliar vocabulary in the context of reading passages helps students learn
                    about the way these words are used as well as how to use context clues to
                    help determine word meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each Unit in <span class="text-primary">VOCABULARY WORKSHOP ACHIEVE</span> opens with a passage
                    containing at least
                    15 of the 20 Unit words in context. These words appear in boldface to draw students’ attention to
                    the way they are used and the contexts in which they appear. Context clues embedded in the passages
                    encourage students to figure out the meanings of words before
                    they study their definitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The topics of the passages are grade-appropriate and of high-interest, and represent a
                    variety of genres, including expository texts, informational essays, historical nonfiction, and
                    biographies. Passages also provide exposure to figurative language such as idioms.

                    passage is available at <span class="text-primary">SadlierConnect.com</span>, in
                    Student & Family Resources. Listening to audio recordings of the passages is particularly
                    helpful to auditory learners, ELL students, and striving readers.

                <p>
                    Instruction for the <b>Reading Passages</b> can be delivered in several ways, depending on
                    students’ reading proficiency levels and the implementation model used. Teachers may
                    choose, during full class or small group instruction, to read aloud the passage to students
                    to model fluent reading, have students read aloud the passages, or assign students to read the
                    passage independently as homework prior to class.

                <div class="text-primary">
                    <span class="x2">Definitions</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    One aspect of developing word consciousness in students involves providing them with
                    definitional information about the word—the meaning or meanings denoted by it. The
                    <b>Definitions</b> section introduces the Unit’s 20 vocabulary words in two sets of 10 words
                    each—<b>Set A</b> and <b>Set B</b>—making mastery of new words more manageable for students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Definitions are clear, useful, and informal explanations, giving students each word’s meaning
                    without extensive detail or secondary connotations. Definitions often include synonyms to better
                    situate the taught word in a semantic family of words closely related in meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A simple abbreviation provides the part of speech with each definition. When a word
                    functions as multiple parts of speech, the appropriate abbreviation appears before the
                    corresponding definition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A word’s pronunciation is indicated by a simple set of diacritical marks. Only one pronunciation is
                    given for each word, except when a word changes its pronunciation in
                    accordance with its use as different parts of speech (for example, <i>ob’ ject</i> for the noun
                    form and <i>ob ject’</i> for the verb).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Concluding each <b>Definition</b> entry is an illustrative sentence. These sentences provide a
                    context that clarifies the meaning of each word and provides students with an opportunity
                    to practice writing and spelling each word in context so that they begin to see how the
                    word can be used effectively in their own writing.

                    Teachers should engage students in discussions about each word and its definition as well
                    as its use in various contexts. Students should develop a meaningful explanation for each
                    word. Visual images may be used to support understanding of a word and its meaning.

                    <b>Using Context</b> is a transitional exercise that gives students the opportunity to determine
                    whether a vocabulary word makes sense in the context of a sentence. In this exercise, students
                    practice strategies for using context to determine whether a word is used correctly, given its
                    meaning as provided in the <b>Definitions</b> section as well as its use in the
                    <b>Reading Passage</b>.

                    B</b>
                    of each Unit. From a pair of words, students choose the word that better completes the
                    sentence. Encourage students to refer to the definitions and example sentence in <b>Definitions</b>.
                    Students’ successful completion of this exercise supports their deepening
                    understanding of word meanings.

                    This activity provides a simple fill-in-the-blank exercise in which students choose and write
                    the word from the 10-word <b>Set</b> that logically and meaningfully completes each sentence.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 0px">
                    When using the exercise in the classroom, teachers should bear in mind the following:

                <ul class="list-disc">
                    <li class="disc">The sentences in this activity call for the literal or direct (as opposed to the

                    <li class="disc">The sentences are designed so that only one of the words fits in the given blank.
                        Context clues have been embedded in each sentence to aid the student in choosing
                        the right word from the word bank.
                    </li>
                    <li class="disc">Students might be reminded (not only at this point but whenever it seems
                        appropriate
                        to do so) of the three types of context clues described and illustrated on page 7 of the
                        Student Edition.
                    </li>
                    <li class="disc">Note also that nouns introduced in the singular in the <b>Definitions</b> section
                        may appear
                        in plural form in the sentences; verbs given in the base form in <b>Definitions</b> may be
                        used in any tense or form (including participial) required by the sentence.

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Teachers may help students with this exercise by prompting them to choose a word that they think
                    fits into the sentence and ask themselves, “Does that sound right? Does that
                    make sense?” If they aren’t sure, they should try another word and ask the same questions.

                    The <b>Synonyms</b> section further allows students to demonstrate their understanding of the
                    new vocabulary words. This exercise, which draws 15 words from <b>Sets A & B</b> combined,
                    reinforces meanings and provides students with examples of usage and context.

                    Teachers may wish to encourage students to use a thesaurus or dictionary to help them

                    Not all words have antonyms. For those that do, however, practice with antonyms reinforces meanings
                    and provides students with further examples of usage and context. The <b>Antonyms</b>
                    section asks students to draw from the Unit’s 20 words the five most nearly opposite in meaning to
                    highlighted antonyms presented in phrases.

                    As with <b>Synonyms</b>, teachers may wish to encourage students to use a thesaurus or

                <p>
                    Students should consider how the antonym of a vocabulary word helps them understand

                    Teachers may provide students with a four-point rubric that will be used to score the exercise. It
                    is best if the rubric aligns with those used on the assessments students most
                    frequently take. Prior to assigning the writing exercise, teachers should model responding
                    to text-based questions and how to cite details from the text to support responses.

                    All Units conclude with <b>Vocabulary in Context</b>, a second reading passage that provides
                    further examples of selected Unit words in context and checks students’ ability to use
                    context within a passage to determine word meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Vocabulary in Context</b> is related in topic or theme to the introductory passage and
                    includes all words that did not appear in that passage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After students read the passage, they must use the knowledge they have gained of the
                    Unit’s words, as well as context clues, to answer questions about the meaning of those
                    words as they appear in the context of the passage. This exercise gives students more practice
                    analyzing words in context, a feature of standards-aligned and state exams.

                    Reviews begin with a two-part <b>Vocabulary for Comprehension</b> feature designed to furnish
                    students with practice in standardized-test formats modeled on the reading sections of
                    standards-aligned and state exams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <b>Vocabulary for Comprehension: Part 1</b>, students are presented with a single nonfiction
                    passage similar to those that appear in standardized exams. Based on their reading of that
                    passage, students must answer questions assessing reading comprehension and
                    vocabulary skills. These assessment items mirror those found in standardized exams and
                    require students to refer to the passage, and occasionally to cite text evidence, in order to
                    answer them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <b>Vocabulary for Comprehension: Part 2</b>, students are presented with either a single
                    passage or paired passages, two texts related in subject matter or theme, and asked to
                    answer questions about those texts, including questions requiring comparative analysis
                    and evaluation. Again, both passages and assessment items are modeled on those that
                    appear in standards-aligned and state exams.

                <p>
                    Synonyms help students enrich and clarify their understanding of vocabulary. The <b>Synonyms</b>
                    section of the Review reinforces meanings and provides students with further examples of usage and
                    context. The synonyms appear in full sentences, and students must choose from a word bank of the
                    Unit words that have the same or nearly the same meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If students have difficulty with the <b>Synonyms</b> exercise, teachers might refer them to the
                    <b>Definitions</b> section in which the Unit words first appeared.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Students use their knowledge of the vocabulary words as well as context clues in the sentence to
                    determine which pair of words should be used to fill in the blanks. Students’ reading comprehension
                    is supported as they are required to use information on either side
                    of the blank to ascertain which vocabulary word should be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Teachers should assign this cloze exercise to provide ongoing practice with the vocabulary
                    and to promote mastery.

                <p>
                    Following each of the five Reviews is a Word Study section that provides instruction and
                    practice in either <b>Idioms</b> or <b>Denotation and Connotation</b>. All Word Study sections also
                    provide instruction and practice in <b>Classical Roots</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the literal meanings of the words that make up an idiom do not help a reader or listener to
                    understand what the idiom is meant to express, idioms are especially problematic for
                    students not well acquainted with the English language. Most languages possess idioms, but
                    English is especially rich in them: “raining cats and dogs,” “the apple of my eye,” and “a
                    dark-horse candidate” are just a few examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By developing a familiarity with and understanding of idioms and other forms of figurative
                    language, students can better comprehend and respond to texts and other forms of written
                    and oral communication.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <div class="text-primary">
                    <span class="x2">Denotation and Connotation</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In this part of the Word Study section, students investigate connotation—positive, negative,
                    or neutral associations of a word—and denotation, the strict, dictionary definition of a word.
                    Understanding the difference between denotation and connotation helps students better
                    appreciate nuances of meaning and author’s purpose or point of view, and helps them better express
                    themselves in their own writing with more discriminating word choices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Teachers may expand on the lesson by having students reflect on connotations associated
                    with categories of words. Ask students to use the table heads provided on the <b>Denotation
                    and Connotation</b> page—neutral, positive, and negative—to complete a table categorizing
                    the words identified in brainstorming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, teachers might prompt students to supply alternatives for the neutral word
                    <i>dog</i>. Discuss whether each word has a negative or positive connotation. If the students are
                    unable to give alternative words, provide examples such as <i>puppy</i>, <i>hound</i>, <i>mutt</i>,
                    <i>pooch</i>,
                    <i>canine</i>, <i>mongrel</i>. Ask students to explain why, in their opinion, each word has a
                    negative or
                    positive connotation.
                </p>

                    <span class="x2">Classical Roots </span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Instruction in classic roots will help students unlock the meanings of thousands of English
                    words derived from Latin and Greek roots. Students will develop a useful and transferable
                    strategy with which to make sense of a multitude of unfamiliar academic words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Combined with an understanding of common affixes, familiarity with Latin and Greek roots
                    can furnish students with a valuable tool in analyzing and decoding new vocabulary.
