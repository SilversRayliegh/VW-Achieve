                <p>Depending on the needs of their students, teachers may differentiate and/or scaffold instruction to accommodate individual or small-group learning differences.</p>
                <p>Students who are on or above grade level often already have a basic understanding of many of the vocabulary words. The goal for these students should not just be to recognize the words, but rather to incorporate them into their personal lexicon for writing and speaking.</p>
                <div class="text-primary x15" style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    Differentiating Daily Instruction for Striving and ELL Students
                </div>
                <p> Begin with audio: Beginning each vocabulary unit by playing the audio of the introductory <b>Reading Passage</b> and the <img style="height: 22px;margin-bottom:-4px" src="images/iw-p6.jpg"> audio of each word being spoken, defined, and used in example sentences can help all learners—especially striving and ELL students— understand how vocabulary words are used in multiple contexts. </p>
                <p> Repeat use of <img style="height: 22px;margin-bottom:-4px" src="images/iw-p6.jpg"> : Having students download and repeatedly listen to the <img style="height: 22px;margin-bottom:-4px" src="images/iw-p6.jpg"> audio can deepen their understanding of word pronunciations and meanings. </p>
                <p> Show examples of correct use in varied contexts: Providing students with opportunities to encounter words repeatedly and in more than one context helps students place these words in their long-term memories and improves word consciousness. </p>
                <p> Provide opportunities for oral practice: Engaging students in actively using the new vocabulary in classroom discussions and conversations allows them to enrich their understanding of the words’ meanings and to make connections between words while building their vocabularies. </p>
                <p> Focus on context clues: Having students underline context clues in the <b>Using Context, Choosing the Right Word</b>, and <b>Completing the Sentence</b> exercises helps them understand how context provides clues to deciphering word meaning. </p>
                <p> Utilize <span class="text-primary">SadlierConnect.com</span> graphic organizers: Using graphic organizers is especially important for striving readers and ELL students as they help learners visualize their words and come to a richer recognition of word meanings. </p>

                    Differentiating Assignments for Striving Readers and ELL Students
                </div>
                <p> Work together: Pair striving and/or ELL students together to complete the Unit’s exercises. They should work at a similar pace and clarify word meaning through discussions over answers. </p>
                <p> Focus on <b>Set A</b> or <b>Set B</b>: In each Unit of 20 words, have striving and ELL students spend all of their time learning one set of 10 words, rather than both sets, and assess accordingly. </p>
                <p> Practice with online exercises at <span class="text-primary">SadlierConnect.com</span>: There are a variety of exercises online that help students gauge for themselves their level of understanding. </p>
                <p> Play online games at <span class="text-primary">SadlierConnect.com</span>: Striving and ELL students especially will enjoy the Test Your Vocabulary and Hangman games, as they make word retention fun and include an audio component to aid in word recognition. </p>

                </div>
                <p> Modify assessments: Reducing the number of incorrect answer choices in test items makes the assessment more accessible and does not harm the psychometric properties of the test. </p>
                <p> Use word banks: Often, giving students a word bank, as in the Synonym activity in the Review sections, allows students to recall words and meanings more easily on tests. </p>
                <p> Create an alternative test: Have students demonstrate their knowledge of words through the real-world medium of their choice. Whether in song lyrics, stories, or artwork, student success should be determined based on correct usage with context and/or an explanation to show understanding. </p>
                <p> Recognize context clues: Consider giving partial credit to students who can underline the context clues correctly in the <b>Completing the Sentence, Vocabulary in Context</b>, and/or <b>Vocabulary for Comprehension</b> exercises when used as assessments. </p>

                    Differentiating Exercises and Assignments for Above Grade-Level Students
                </div>
                <p> Use words in conversations: During discussions of current events or literature, teachers can require students to use vocabulary words when making claims and expressing ideas. </p>
                <p> Categorize vocabulary: Have students not only learn word meanings but also categorize words as they relate to general labels such as “travel words,” “food words,” or “compliments versus insults,” for example. </p>
                <p> Get to the root of it: The <b>Classical Roots</b> Word Study activity and the <span class="text-primary">SadlierConnect.com</span> <b>Greek and Latin Roots Matching Challenge</b> help students move beyond individual word meaning to understanding the roots of words and etymological concepts, and to build their own vocabularies. </p>
                <p> Utilize Vocab Gal’s resources: The Vocab Gal blog (<span class="text-primary">Sadlier.com/school/vocab-gal</span>) has more than 100 games and exercises designed to help students of all abilities learn and retain vocabulary in fun and engaging ways. </p>

                    Differentiating Assessment for Above Grade-Level Students
                </div>
                <p> Pre-assess: The <b>Using Context</b> and <b>Choosing the Right Word</b> exercises can be used as pre-assessments for students. Based on their scores, students can opt out of completing the workbook exercises and go straight to the <b>Writing: Words in Action</b>. Students should include in their writing the words they did not get correct on the pretest. </p>
                <p> Assign a written test: Consider using the <b>Writing: Words in Action</b> activity as a Unit assessment, with students required to use several of the vocabulary words in their responses. Alternatively, have students write on topics of their (or your) choice. </p>
                <p> Practice for standardized tests: The <b>Vocabulary for Comprehension</b> exercises in the Review sections provide other ways to assess students not only on their vocabulary knowledge but also on literary analysis questions crucial to success on standardized tests. </p>
